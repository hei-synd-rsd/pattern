 *
 * \section sec_xf_intro Introduction
 *
 * This library implements an e<b>X</b>ecution <b>F</b>ramework (XF) to drive finite
 * state machines. Using this framework, it is possible to drive multiple state machines
 * in a concurrent manner (pseudo-parallel) without having an operating system.
 *
 * The XF defines an interface which gives the ability to reimplement parts of the XF to
 * make changes to an other target/platform.
 *
 * \section sec_xf_comp XF Component Diagram
 * The XF is split into two parts. One part is the **%XF core** containing classes which
 * never change across platforms. The other part is the **%XF port** containing classes
 * adjusted for a specific platform:

 *
 * The XF core together with a port forms a complete XF which can be integrated into
 * a software project.
 *
 * \section sec_xf_cmd XF Class Diagram
 *
 * Following class diagram shows the basic relations between the most important classes
 * in the RSD XF. It shall give you a basic understanding about the relations between
 * these classes:

 *
 * \section sec_xf_start Starting Point
 *
 * A good point to jump into the definitions of the classes is the `XF` class. Other classes
 * of interest are `interface::XFDispatcher`, `interface::XFBehavior` and XFEvent.

 * \section sec_xf_releases XF Releases
 * \subsection xf_v_5_1_0 XF Version: 5.1.0 (2025-11)
 * - sth: Added QUEUE_MAX_ELEMENTS constant
 * - sth: Added check that event could be pushed onto queue
 * \subsection xf_v_5_0_0 XF Version: 5.0.0 (2024-11)
 * - sth: Changed constructor of XFCustomEvent class
 * - sth: Added Zephyr thread name support
 * - sth: Added check that dispatcher is created properly
 * \subsection xf_v_2_0_1 XF Version: 2.0.1 (2025-09)
 * - sth: Removed 'timeInterval' parameter from XF::initialize(...) method. Neither the Qt nor the Zephyr port needs it.
 * \subsection xf_v_2_0_0 XF Version: 2.0.0 (2024-09)
 * - sth: Updated XF interface. Removed XFTimeout class. Now every XFEvent can be delayed.
 * - sth: Renamed 'Simplified %XF' to '%XF'
 * - sth: Two ports available: Zephyr and Qt 
 * \subsection xf_v_1_1_0 Simplified XF Version: 1.1.0 (2022-09)
 * - sth: Removed some no more neeted attributes and parameters from classes
 * - sth: Added support for MSVC compiler
 * - sth: Updated Qt port to support Qt library v6.x
 * - sth: Added for Qt port a TRACE_ENABLE_TIMESTAMP define to output traces with a timestamp
 * \subsection xf_v_1_0_0 Simplified XF Version: 1.0.0 (2021-07)
 * - sth: Removed from 'Full %XF' the OS support and created with that the 'Simplified %XF'
